# 🔍 Customer Retention Analysis — BCG X Virtual Experience (Forage)

This repository contains my completed data science project from the **BCG X Data Science Job Simulation** hosted on Forage. The goal of the project was to analyze customer and pricing data for a fictional energy provider, PowerCo, and provide data-driven insights to improve customer retention.

## 🧠 Objective

The main objectives of this simulation were to:

- Understand PowerCo’s business challenge related to customer churn.
- Explore and analyze customer and pricing data.
- Engineer meaningful features and build predictive models.
- Communicate actionable insights and recommendations to business stakeholders.



---

## 📊 Key Techniques

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Uncovered trends, outliers, and multicollinearity in the datasets.
- **Feature Engineering:** Created new variables including tenure, price differences, and usage patterns.
- **Modeling:** Trained a Random Forest classifier to predict customer churn.
- **Evaluation:** Used metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and cross-validation to assess model performance.
- **Insights:** Delivered data-backed recommendations for retention strategies.

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies

- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, Matplotlib)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Git & GitHub

---

## ✅ Results & Recommendations

- Identified key drivers of customer churn such as high peak pricing and low tenure.
- Recommended pricing adjustments and targeted retention strategies for high-risk customers.
- Proposed next steps for business experimentation and deeper customer segmentation.
